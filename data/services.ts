        question: "What happens if I die without a will in New York?",
        answer:
          "Dying without a will (intestate) means New York's intestacy laws determine who inherits your assets, which may not align with your wishes. Generally, assets pass to your closest relatives in a specific order: spouse, children, parents, siblings, etc. Additionally, the court will appoint a guardian for minor children without your input, and the probate process may be more complicated and expensive.",

        question: "How can I minimize estate taxes?",

The appropriate approach depends on your asset level, goals, and family situation. We develop customized tax planning strategies as part of your comprehensive estate plan.",

        question: "What's the difference between patents, trademarks, and copyrights?",
        answer:
          "Patents protect inventions and functional innovations, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention for a limited time (typically 20 years). Trademarks protect brand identifiers like names, logos, and slogans that distinguish your goods or services from others. Copyrights protect original creative works such as writings, music, art, and software from being copied, distributed, or adapted without permission.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take to get a patent?",
        answer:
          "The patent process typically takes 2-4 years from filing to issuance, though it can be shorter or longer depending on the technology area, complexity of the invention, and USPTO backlog. Expedited examination options are available for additional fees. During the pendency period, your application is labeled 'patent pending,' which provides some deterrent effect against potential infringers.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to register my copyright?",
        answer:
          "While copyright protection exists automatically when you create an original work, registration with the U.S. Copyright Office provides important benefits. Registration is required before filing an infringement lawsuit, and timely registration (within three months of publication or before infringement) allows you to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees. Registration also creates a public record of your ownership and provides presumptive evidence of validity.",
      },
      {
        question: "How can I protect my business's confidential information?",
        answer:
          "Protecting confidential information typically involves a multi-layered approach: 1) Identify what information constitutes trade secrets; 2) Implement physical and electronic security measures; 3) Use confidentiality agreements with employees, contractors, and business partners; 4) Establish clear policies regarding access and handling of sensitive information; 5) Mark confidential documents appropriately; and 6) Create an incident response plan for potential breaches.",
